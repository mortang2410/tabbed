tabbed - generic tabbed interface
=================================
tabbed is a simple tabbed X window container.

Requirements
------------
In order to build tabbed you need the Xlib header files.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (tabbed is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default). I have already set it to Ubuntu's default locations.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install tabbed (assuming you're using Ubuntu/Debian):

    sudo checkinstall make clean install

Running tabbed
--------------
See the man page for details.
